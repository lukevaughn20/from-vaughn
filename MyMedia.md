# Luke Vaughn

I would have to say that my favorite video would be Star Wars EPS 6 Return of the Jedi. 
One intersting fact about this movie is that Jabba's palace was full of animtronic work. 
Along with that throughout the whole original trilogy there was real people in both the 
R2-D2 and C-3PO suits. And finally Luke Skywalker made his own lightsaber for the movie.
